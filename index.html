			<p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Corey Watts</span> and I'm a <span itemprop="title">Software Engineer</span> with <span itemprop="affiliation">Brightidea, Inc</span>, located in lovely in <span itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address"><span itemprop="locality">San Francisco</span>, <span itemprop="region">California</span></span>. I have a passion for computers and crafting beautiful web applications.  I graduated from Westmont College with a B.S. in Computer Science several years ago, and I'm been working as a software engineer ever since.</p>

		<p>I LOVE PHP, MVC, Vim, SQL, and Linux -- these are the tools I immerse myself in daily to get the job done.  I'm a LAMP Stack snob and I can't imagine developing in anything else, except maybe on a mac. My professors at Westmont ingrained in me a passion for elegant solutions, so in every piece of code I write I try to make it as simple and effective as possible. I truly believe that it's the little details that make or break a project, so I strive to get every part right.</p>

		<p>In addition to being a software engineer, I have some significant experience in the system administration world. I worked as a Linux System Administrator for a year and a half back in college, and I enjoy occasionally setting up or working on servers.</p>

		<p>In my free time, I enjoy learning about and wearing watches, appreciating Scotch Whiskies, lifting weights, and traveling. You can read more about these things at my blog.</p>
