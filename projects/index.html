			<h4 class="contentSmallTitle">kelly scheduling system</h4>
			<p class="contentText">I'm in the process of developing a simple web application to provide firefighters and EMTs an easy-to-use interface to the Kelly scheduling system.  24 hour shift workers often work on the Kelly Schedule.  This unique work schedule is one day on, one day off, one day on, one day off, one day on, then four days off.  There are three teams that work staggered shifts so that one team ends up working each day.  I'm building an elegant web calendar to display this information.</p>

			<h4 class="contentSmallTitle">net responsibility</h4>
			<p class="contentText"><a href="http://netresponsibility.com">Net Responsibility</a> is an open source project I got involved in the summer of 2011.  It provides internet accountability software to users of Linux and OS X and soon, Windows.  I wrote some of the javascript functionality in the email report attachments and headed development and compatibility with OS X.  I wrote a launchd script to start the program on boot and had made quite a bit of progress in packaging the application for OS X before my mac laptop died :(</p>

			<h4 class="contentSmallTitle">ndms merchant application</h4>
			<p class="contentText">My company's merchant signup online application wasn't working, and they decided they wanted something different.  I was assigned the task of creating a shiny new application for them that was able to be branded for partners.  What they wanted was the ability to quickly crank out branded applications for each partner.  This turned out to be a very fun project; I had a great time designing the architecture.  I decided to use the <a href="http://yiiframework.com">Yii framework</a> for this because I had been very impressed with Yii in the past and I wanted to learn more about the framework.</p>
			<p class="contentText">I decided to use a modular approach in designing the architecture, so that it would be trivial to add completely different versions of our application in case one partner had significantly different requirements.  Addiionally, all the branding aspects (including partner logo, background color, partner name, etc.) would be handled by database entries.  This allows a non-technical user to quickly set up a new partner application through specifying a few database fields in a frontend GUI.  I accomplished the partner branding by doing a database lookup on that partner name (which is specified in the url) and grabbing the corresponding module name and branding variables, then returning the correct partner application to the user.  You can check it out at <a href="https://application.ndmscorp.com/ndms">https://application.ndmscorp.com/ndms</a>. One of the partner-branded applications can be seen at <a href="https://application.ndmscorp.com/zingcheckout">https://application.ndmscorp.com/zingcheckout</a>.</p>

			<h4 class="contentSmallTitle">matt's racks</h4>
			<p class="contentText">My good friend Matt recently began his own company that builds handmade wooden wine racks in sunny Santa Barbara.  He launched a website (<a href="http://mattsracks.com">http://mattsracks.com</a>) to sell his products and he needed some help getting it SEO friendly.  I gave him a number of suggestions and wrote some custom .htaccess rewrite rules to improve his site's appeal to search engines.</p>

			<h4 class="contentSmallTitle">programming</h4>
			<p class="contentText">If you haven't noticed, I love programming.  I'm a problem-solver at heart.  I love taking a problem, looking at it from all angles, and forming an attack plan. I really have a passion for creating software that helps people and makes their lives (and mine) easier.  Eliminating monotonous repetition via a clever script, providing a way for people to keep track of and manage data, or finding a way to communicate information in an elegant manner are all things that I get really excited about. Programming is a way for me to be creative -- I can express my way of looking at the world and approaching problems through my code.  Besides doing programming at work, I always try to be involved in other personal projects or open source projects.</p>

			<h4 class="contentSmallTitle">magic</h4>
			<p class="contentText">Sleight-of-hand magic has been a passion of mine since I was a child. I love the technical difficulty of sleights and I love that I can brighten people's day through sharing this part of me.  It's not about fooling people; rather it's about inviting them to question their presuppositions and assumptions.  Magic has a great power to bring people joy and a child-like wonder.  I find the psychology behind it fascinating, it is astounding how easily we are deceived.  I've performed everywhere from on the street, to parties, to conferences and I've loved every minute of it.  Are you interested in hiring me for your next event?  Hit me up on the contact page and we can discuss it.</p>
