website
=======

This is my website/resume/blog. It's a jekyll site.

Before generating the site, you should run a bundle install to get the required gems, I'm using a couple of them.

The default rake task ('rake') should get you up and running with a server.

You can check out the actual live site at http://corwatts.com.

Enjoy!
