      <p>My name is Corey Watts and I'm a Software Engineer with Alexa Internet, located in lovely San Francisco, California . I have a passion for computers and crafting beautiful web applications.  I graduated from Westmont College with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2011 and I've working as a software engineer ever since.</p>

    <p>Vim and GNU/Linux are my goto tools. I mostly work in NodeJS, PHP, and SQL, but I have experience and skills in many other languages and tools.</p>
    
    <p>My professors at Westmont ingrained in me a passion for elegant solutions, so in every piece of code I write I try to make it as simple and effective as possible. I truly believe that it's the little details that make or break a project, so I strive to get every part right.</p>

		<p>In addition to being a software engineer, I have significant experience in the system administration world. I worked as a Linux System Administrator for a year and a half back in college, and I enjoy occasionally setting up or working on servers.</p>

		<p>In my free time, I enjoy learning about and wearing watches, appreciating Scotch Whiskies, lifting weights, and traveling. You can read more about these things at my blog.</p>
