			<h1>things i'm doing</h1>
			<p>If you want to check out some of the code I've written, check out my <a href="{{ site.github }}">Github profile</a>. I also host code demos <a href="http://code.corwatts.com/">here</a>. The items below are all things I've worked on in my personal time.</p>

			<h2>revolvingchore</h2>
			<p><a href="http://revolvingchore.com">RevolvingChore</a> is a Ruby on Rails web app several friends and I built for a community college class we took recently. It is a chore chart tracker/generator application, created to make managing chores easier. We were living in a house with six guys, and chores were not always getting done. We attempted to print out a chore chart each month to tape to the fridge, but we often forgot. We knew it could be better, and much cooler, if it was an online application.</p>
			<p>The user logs on with their Facebook account, creates a group, invites the other members of their house, and creates several chores. The app automatically assigns chores, cycles them, and sends reminders to do them. When a chore is completed, the users simply log on and mark it as completed. If a member of the group does not complete their chore by the end of the chore period, RevolvingChore will post a customized message on their Facebook wall. Accountability through public shaming! My favorite part of the app, however, is the plethora of interesting analytics we've added. I found a fantastic Javascript/HTML5 graphing library called <a href="http://chartjs.org">ChartJS</a> which displays gorgeous, animated graphs. We have them all over the place on this app. We have charts showing which chores are most and least often completed, overall completion over time, who completes their chores the most and least often, and other fun pieces of information.</p>
			<p>This app is running on my VPS, with Nginx, Thin, and a PostgreSQL backend. We deploy with Capistrano which, by the way, is completely incredible. We made a bit of an effort to write efficient code, so although my VPS is fairly minimalistic, this app is still quite speedy.</p>

			<h2>net responsibility</h2>
			<p><a href="http://netresponsibility.com">Net Responsibility</a> is an open source project I got involved in the summer of 2011.  It provides internet accountability software to users of Linux and OS X and soon, Windows.  I wrote some of the javascript functionality in the email report attachments and headed development and compatibility with OS X.  I wrote a launchd script to start the program on boot and had made quite a bit of progress in packaging the application for OS X before my mac laptop died :( More recently, I've been doing most of the sysadmin work on the VPS we use, in addition to tweaks here and there to our PHP web app that interfaces with our desktop application. We have plans to completely rewrite our web app in the near future, which I will most likely be working on if I can find the time to do it.</p>

			<h2>matt's racks</h2>
			<p>My good friend Matt recently began his own company that builds handmade wooden wine racks in sunny Santa Barbara.  He launched a website (<a href="http://mattsracks.com">http://mattsracks.com</a>) to sell his products and he needed some help getting it SEO friendly.  I gave him a number of suggestions and wrote some custom .htaccess rewrite rules to improve his site's appeal to search engines.</p>
