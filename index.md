### bio
My name is Corey Watts and I'm a web developer in Santa Barbara. I have a passion for computers and crafting beautiful web applications.  I recently graduated from Westmont College with a B.S. in Computer Science and I've put my degree to good use getting a job as a Web Architect with National Discount Merchant Services ([http://ndmscorp.com](http://ndmscorp.com)). I'm one of only two developers, so I have my hand in every pot: I'm doing everything from server administration, to integration API programming, to creating full-on web applications. I am constantly switching hats at work which keeps me interested.  Most of my work involves developing an online payments application we've recently launched called PaidYet ([http://www.paidyet.com](http://www.paidyet.com)).

I LOVE PHP, MVC, jQuery, SQL, and Linux -- these are the tools I immerse myself in daily to get the job done.  I'm a LAMP Stack snob and I can't imagine developing in anything else, except maybe on a mac. My professors at Westmont ingrained in me a passion for elegant solutions, so in every piece of code I write I try to make it as simple and effective as possible. I truly believe that it's the little details that make or break a project, so I strive to get every part right.
