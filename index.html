<h1>bio</h1>
<p>My name is Corey Watts and I'm a software engineer in Berkeley, California. I have a passion for computers and crafting beautiful web applications.  I graduated from Westmont College with a B.S. in Computer Science several years ago. I'm currently doing freelance and contract work for a number of companies in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>I LOVE PHP, MVC, jQuery, SQL, and Linux -- these are the tools I immerse myself in daily to get the job done.  I'm a LAMP Stack snob and I can't imagine developing in anything else, except maybe on a mac. My professors at Westmont ingrained in me a passion for elegant solutions, so in every piece of code I write I try to make it as simple and effective as possible. I truly believe that it's the little details that make or break a project, so I strive to get every part right.</p>

<p>In addition to being an engineer, I have some significant experience in the system administration world. I worked as a Linux System Administrator for a year and a half back in college, and I enjoy occasionally setting up or working on servers.</p>
