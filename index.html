<h1>bio</h1>
<p>My name is Corey Watts and I'm a web developer in Santa Barbara. I have a passion for computers and crafting beautiful web applications.  I graduated from Westmont College with a B.S. in Computer Science and I've put my degree to good use getting a job as a Software Engineer with Landmark Global (<a href="http://landmarkglobal.com/">http://landmarkglobal.com</a>). I'm doing lots of PHP development on our online parcel management system, Mercury.</p>

<p>I LOVE PHP, MVC, jQuery, SQL, and Linux -- these are the tools I immerse myself in daily to get the job done.  I'm a LAMP Stack snob and I can't imagine developing in anything else, except maybe on a mac. My professors at Westmont ingrained in me a passion for elegant solutions, so in every piece of code I write I try to make it as simple and effective as possible. I truly believe that it's the little details that make or break a project, so I strive to get every part right.</p>
